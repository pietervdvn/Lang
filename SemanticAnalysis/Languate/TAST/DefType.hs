{- Each type has a kind. You can think of those as the 'type of the type'
E.g. a 'Maybe' is always in function of a second argument, e.g. 'Maybe Int' or 'Maybe String'.
'String' and ''Functor Int'' have a kind ''a'' (no arguments), whereas ''Functor'' has a kind ''a -> b''
Type requirements are **not** stored into the kind, these are checked seperatly.

e.g.
type True a b	= a	:: * ~> * ~> *
type False a b	= b	:: * ~> * ~> *
type And b1 b2 a b = b2 (b1 a b) b
			:: (* ~> * ~> *) ~> (* ~> * ~> *) ~> *
